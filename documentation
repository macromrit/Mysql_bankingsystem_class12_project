Description:
    A Bank alike Software.. Which infact is capable of transferring, receiving, depositing and withdrawing funds. To add-on with.. 
    This beauty got the ability to mail users about fund-transactions transpiring via the user's account. That isn't all... 
    Super-User access is the killer-bite of the whole segment, which basically approves an admin validated user to access crude data and 
    display confidential info's of an user as per the super-user's wish.

Medium of transactions:
    -> '$' a.k.a USD [United States Dollar]

Libraries and modules used:
    matplotlib -> install it via pip.
    datetime -> to display the time [pre-installed].
    time -> to let program sleep for a sec or two [pre-installed].
    mysql -> install it via pip. used to integrate python with mysql db.
    smtplib -> used to handle email via python [pre-installed] [fullform: simple-mail-transfer-protocol-library].
    random -> to generate unique id [pre-installed].
    email -> to make the email server linkage primitive [pre-installed].
    yagmail -> to send email with attachments like csv
    speedtest -> to detect whether the pgm would be able to send email or not which pseudopodiumatically relies on internet upload and download speed


Set of Mysql commands to be executed before running the program:
    ->  Command I:
        CREATE DATABASE banking_system;

    ->  Command II:
        USE banking_system;

    ->  Command III:
        CREATE TABLE IF not exists account_holders(
        name varchar(120), 
        gender char(1),
        age int, 
        nationality varchar(100), 
        unique_id char(10), 
        phone_no varchar(20),
        email varchar(80),
        date_created varchar(252),
        balance FLOAT, 
        password varchar(108),
        primary key(unique_id));
    
    ->  Command IV:
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS history(
        user_id char(10), 
        mode varchar(100), 
        amount float, 
        rec_user_id char(10));
       

Connecting Gmail with python:
    -> Turn on google
    -> Go To Security of your account
    -> Then turn less secure apps on
    -> Atlast make necessary modifications to the email_bot file
    -> Then you are gr8 to go.


Files:
    ->main.py:
        The grand-dad of all files.. this is the peculiar and ultimate destination where the files existing would colloborate togther 
	    to make the whole system of process work like charm.

    ->crude_fun.py:
        A typical module portraying file.. Got all the fundamental functions to pretty the output and intimate user about what's going on.

    ->database.py:
        Horizon where most of the data-related functions reside.. Its a typical module-portraying file.. 
	    way similiar to the prior. It consists of stuffs related to transactions i.e: bunchies like withdrawal, deposital and thingys that sort, come under this genre.

    ->email_bot.py:
        Gotta employ somebody to dust off chores.. And that's where email_bot comes under action. This kuddo send's email to the users by establishing 
	    smtp server in the most efficient way out there. Might consume some time. But worth the span.

    ->super_user.py:
        The ultimate bucket list which comprises a mapping eventually making that mapping store super-user name and their passkey to get the super-user access.

    ->unique_code_gen.py:
        Generating stuffs are pretty simple.. But human effort kills worthy span. unique_code_gen makes it sweet by manufacturing an unique id for a user 
	    which inturn is contrasted with the id's available from the database. Atlast if stuffs work right an unique id is generated.


functions created:
    ->crude_fun.py:
        -> cust_inp : to receive input from the user in the best way possible.
        -> ref_all  : to reflect data reciept depending on the transactions made.
        -> void_sep : to leave blank lines while running the program.
        -> func_sep : to seperate functionalites done by the user while running the program.
